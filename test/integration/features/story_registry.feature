Feature: Local image to image-registry

    User creates a local container image with an app inside it. They then
    push it to the OpenShift image-registry in their project/namespace.
    They deploy and expose the app and check its accessibility.

    Scenario: Start CRC and login to cluster
        Given executing "crc setup" succeeds
        When starting CRC with default bundle succeeds
        Then stdout should contain "Started the OpenShift cluster"
        When checking that CRC is running
        Then executing "eval $(crc oc-env)" succeeds
        And login to the oc cluster succeeds

    Scenario: Create local image
        Given executing "sudo podman build -t hello:test -f Dockerfile" succeeds
        When executing "sudo podman images" succeeds
        Then stdout should contain "localhost/hello"
        
    Scenario: Push local image to OpenShift image registry
        Given executing "oc new-project testproj-img" succeeds
        When executing "sudo podman login -u kubeadmin -p $(oc whoami -t) default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing --tls-verify=false" succeeds
        Then stdout should contain "Login Succeeded!"
        When executing "sudo podman push hello:test default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing/testproj-img/hello:test --tls-verify=false" succeeds

    Scenario: Deploy the image
        Given executing "oc new-app testproj-img/hello:test" succeeds
        When executing "oc rollout status deployment hello" succeeds
        Then stdout should contain "successfully rolled out"
        When executing "oc get pods" succeeds
        Then stdout should contain "Running"
        When executing "oc logs deployment/hello" succeeds
        Then stdout should contain "Hello, it works!"

    Scenario: Clean up
        Given executing "sudo podman images" succeeds
        When stdout contains "localhost/hello"
        Then executing "sudo podman image rm localhost/hello:test" succeeds
        And executing "oc delete project testproj-img" succeeds
        When executing "crc stop -f" succeeds
        Then stdout should match "(.*)[Ss]topped the OpenShift cluster"
        And executing "crc delete -f" succeeds
        Then stdout should contain "Deleted the OpenShift cluster"
        When executing "crc cleanup" succeeds
        Then stdout should contain "Cleanup finished"
